# `spacectl`, the Spacelift CLI

`spacectl` is a utility wrapping Spacelift's [GraphQL API](https://docs.spacelift.io/integrations/api) for easy programmatic access in command-line contexts - either in manual interactive mode (in your local shell), or in a predefined CI pipeline (GitHub actions, CircleCI, Jenkins etc).

## Installation

### Homebrew

You can install `spacectl` using Homebrew on MacOS or Linux:

```bash
brew install spacelift-io/spacelift/spacectl
```

### Arch linux

Install [`spacectl-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spacectl-bin) from the Arch User Repository ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)):
```bash
yay -S spacectl-bin
```

Disclaimer: The package is community-maintained, please make sure to verify the [`PKGBUILD`](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=spacectl-bin) before installing/updating.

### GitHub Release

Alternatively, `spacectl` is distributed through GitHub Releases as a zip file containing a self-contained statically linked executable built from the source in this repository. Binaries can be download directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/spacelift-io/spacectl/releases).

### Usage on GitHub Actions

We have [setup-spacectl](https://github.com/spacelift-io/setup-spacectl) GitHub Action that can be used to install `spacectl`:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install spacectl
    uses: spacelift-io/setup-spacectl@main
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  - name: Deploy infrastructure
    env:
      SPACELIFT_API_ENDPOINT: https://mycorp.app.spacelift.io
      SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID }}
      SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET }}
    run: spacectl stack deploy --id my-infra-stack
```

## Quick Start

Authenticate using `spacectl profile login`:

```bash
> spacectl profile login my-account
Enter Spacelift endpoint (eg. https://unicorn.app.spacelift.io/): http://my-account.app.spacelift.tf
Select authentication flow: 
  1) for API key,
  2) for GitHub access token,
  3) for login with a web browser
Option: 3
```

Use spacectl :rocket::

```bash
> spacectl stack list
Name                          | Commit   | Author        | State     | Worker Pool | Locked By
stack-1                       | 1aa0ef62 | Adam Connelly | NONE      |             |
stack-2                       | 1aa0ef62 | Adam Connelly | DISCARDED |             |
```

## Getting Help

To list all the commands available, use `spacectl help`:

```bash
> spacectl help
NAME:
   spacectl - Programmatic access to Spacelift GraphQL API

USAGE:
   spacectl [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   profile  Manage Spacelift profiles
   stack    Manage a Spacelift stack
   version  Print out CLI version
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help (default: false)
```

To get help about a particular command or subcommand, use the `-h` flag:

```bash
> spacectl profile -h
NAME:
   spacectl profile - Manage Spacelift profiles

USAGE:
   spacectl profile command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   current       Outputs your currently selected profile
   export-token  Prints the current token to stdout. In order not to leak, we suggest piping it to your OS pastebin
   list          List all your Spacelift account profiles
   login         Create a profile for a Spacelift account
   logout        Remove Spacelift credentials for an existing profile
   select        Select one of your Spacelift account profiles
   help, h       Shows a list of commands or help for one command

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help (default: false)
```

## Example

The following screencast shows an example of using spacectl to run a one-off task in Spacelift:

## Authentication

`spacectl` is designed to work in two different contexts - a non-interactive scripting mode (eg. external CI/CD pipeline) and a local interactive mode, where you type commands into your shell. Because of this, it supports two types of credentials - environment variables and user profiles.

We refer to each method of providing credentials as "credential providers" (like AWS), and details of each method are documented in the following sections.

### Authenticating using environment variables

The CLI supports the following authentication methods via the environment:

- [Spacelift API tokens](#spacelift-api-tokens).
- [GitHub tokens](#github-tokens).
- [Spacelift API keys](#spacelift-api-keys).

`spacectl` looks for authentication configurations in the order specified above, and will stop as soon as it finds a valid configuration. For example, if a Spacelift API token is specified, GitHub tokens and Spacelift API keys will be ignored, even if their environment variables are specified.

#### Spacelift API tokens

Spacelift API tokens can be specified using the `SPACELIFT_API_TOKEN` environment variable. When this variable is found, the CLI ignores all the other authentication environment variables because the token contains all the information needed to authenticate.

NOTE: API tokens are generally short-lived and will need to be re-created often.

#### GitHub tokens

GitHub tokens are only available to accounts that use GitHub as their identity provider, but are very convenient for use in GitHub actions. To use a GitHub token, set the following environment variables:

- `SPACELIFT_API_ENDPOINT` - the URL to your Spacelift account, for example `https://mycorp.app.spacelift.io`.
- `SPACELIFT_API_GITHUB_TOKEN` - a GitHub personal access token.

#### Spacelift API keys

To use a Spacelift API key, set the following environment variables:

- `SPACELIFT_API_ENDPOINT` - the URL to your Spacelift account, for example `https://mycorp.app.spacelift.io`.
- `SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID` - the ID of your Spacelift API key. Available via the Spacelift application.
- `SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET` - the secret for your API key. Only available when the secret is created.

More information about API authentication can be found at <https://docs.spacelift.io/integrations/api#authenticating-with-the-api>.

### Authenticating using account profiles

In order to make working with multiple Spacelift accounts easy in interactive scenarios, Spacelift supports account management through the `profile` family of commands:

```bash
❯ spacectl profile
NAME:
   spacectl profile - Manage Spacelift profiles

USAGE:
   spacectl profile command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   current  Outputs your currently selected profile
   list     List all your Spacelift account profiles
   login    Create a profile for a Spacelift account
   logout   Remove Spacelift credentials for an existing profile
   select   Select one of your Spacelift account profiles
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help (default: false)
```

Each of the subcommands requires an account **alias**, which is a short, user-friendly name for each set of credentials (account profiles). Profiles don't need to be unique - you can have multiple sets of credentials for a single account too.

Account profiles support three authentication methods: GitHub access tokens, API keys and login with a browser (API token). In order to authenticate to your first profile, type in the following (make sure to replace `${MY_ALIAS}` with the actual profile alias):

```bash
❯ spacectl profile login ${MY_ALIAS}
Enter Spacelift endpoint (eg. https://unicorn.app.spacelift.io/):
```

In the next step, you will be asked to choose which authentication method you are going to use. Note that if your account is using [SAML-based SSO authentication](https://docs.spacelift.io/integrations/single-sign-on), then API keys and login with a browser are your only options. After you're done entering credentials, the CLI will validate them against the server, and assuming that they're valid, will persist them in a credentials file in `.spacelift/${MY_ALIAS}`. It will also create a symlink in `${HOME}/.spacelift/current` pointing to the current profile.

You can switch between account profiles by using `spacectl profile select ${MY_ALIAS}`. What this does behind the scenes is point `${HOME}/.spacelift/current` to the new location. You can also delete stored credetials for a given profile by using the `spacectl profile logout ${MY_ALIAS}` command.
